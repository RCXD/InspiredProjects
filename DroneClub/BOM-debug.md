# Background Knowledges

## 1. Core Parts  

### 1-1. FC(Flight Controller)  
This part consists of the main processor(Micro Processor Unit, or MPU), peripheral device control pins, and sensors  
### 1-2. ESC(Electric Speed Controller)  
This part helps FCs to control high-power motors. FCs don't have huge power. FC is the smartest but weakest part of a drone. We use ESC when we use BLDC motors, and the BLDC motor is dominant. If your drone has 6 motors(hexacopter), you need 6 ESCs.  
### 1-3. PMU(Power Management Module) or Power supply module  
Small drones normally use FCs with PMU or All-in-one ESC with PMU. Bigger drones sometimes need PMU.  
### 1-4. Battery  
Lipo(Lithium Polymer) battery technology lets drones fly. This type of battery has high capacity, high electric currents, and stability. Lithium cell batteries may explode, but Lipo won't explode. They just burn. :) Big drones should have high voltage batteries, so you should use 3s(Serial 3 cells) or higher batteries. 
`3s lipo has 11.1V(3.7*3)`. 2s or higher batteries should charge using "Balance Charger" and discharge to storage voltage if you are going to store your battery for a long time. mAh or Wh means its capacity and C(coulomb) means its ability to discharge. If a 1000mAh battery has 100C, it can discharge a maximum of 100A. `(Maximum current = capacity*C)`  
### 1-5. Motor  
We usually use a BLDC motor rather than a DC motor. Some micro drones use coreless DC motor(small, strong, more expensive than DC), but BLDC is dominant. All motors must have a corresponding driver circuit. DC and coreless DC motor's driver is simple and small, but BLDC's is so much complicated. So they need ESC modules.  
### 1-6. Radiofrequency PPM Receiver/transmitter  
RF(Radio Frequency) is also an interesting area. PPM(Pulse Position Modulation) technology is now the dominant, reliable type of pulse modulation to control your drones safely.  
### 1-7. Propellers
A quadcopter uses 2 CW(clock-wise) motors and 2 CCW(counter-clock-wise) motors. So, they need corresponding propellers.
        
## 2. Additional Parts (Read this if you are interested in challenging DIY projects.)  
### 2-1. FPV: First Person View  
This part consists of a camera, radio frequency transmitter, and MPU(Media Processing Unit). This allows you to control your drone from its perspective. You may use FPV goggles, such as a VR(Virtual Reality) headset.  
### 2-2. MPU: Media Processing Unit  
For advanced drones, often have various types of sensors. Such as stereo camera sensors(you can easily see under the many DJI drones). This technology is based on highly developed Sensor Fusion technology and Image/Signal Processing Technology. To implement this technology into drones, they must have this unit. This technology is not opened for everyone, but you can challenge using Raspberry Pi and odometry projects.  
### 2-3. GPS: Global Positioning System  
GPS is a useful technology for outdoor drone hovering and guided flight. It helps drones to fly without a driver's control signal.  
### 2-4. Other actuators  
Some FPV systems include gimbals which help a camera to take so much stable video without any post-processing. Gimbal helps drones using physical motors. Some FC support gimbal control. This technology and OIS technology in an expensive smartphone's camera have the same idea. On the other hand, you can add all kinds of actuators(especially motors), like a robot arm, but you may need an additional processor circuit because most FCs don't support custom actuators of your system.  
### 2-5. More challenge  
You can leave controlling your drone to your FC and think of something else. However, you can also try to control your drone without FC's help. If you use open-sourced FCs, you must study a lot but at least you may feel the depth of the control system theory. In online markets, there are old open source projects which became legacy these days.  

## 3. Limitation of DIY  
### 3-1. You need to understand the basic concepts of electric circuit theory. 
At least you need to know that a red wire and a black wire should not join. If they were of a lithium battery, it will be on fire.  
### 3-2. Drones will ask you if you are understanding basic flight theory.
Such as trimming, roll-pitch-yaw, hovering, etc.  
### 3-3. Some parts will ask you a deep understanding of engineering skills.
### 3-4. You need to know how to calculate necessary physical quantities to search for proper parts in online markets.  
### 3-5. Unfortunately, drones cannot fly on their own with just one sensor. 
Basically, FCs have a gyro-accelerometer sensor. But they cannot measure its current position, like every modern sensor has its limit. To solve this problem, you can add another type of sensor, such as GPS, image flow sensor, etc. However, sensor fusion is based on extremely complicated mathematics. So, we should rely on FCs' help.
